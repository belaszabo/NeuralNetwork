# NeuralNetwork

A simple neural network implementation which you can train easily.

To try this you must set `--experimental-modules` argument to node.

Two examples
## xor

xor.mjs

Teaches the NN to XOR. The input is an array of two bits, the output Neuron will converge to the right answer:P


## alphabet classifier

characterClassifier.mjs

You tell the NN which character is a number, consonant or a vowel, then it tries to guess it.
There are 3 Neurons at the output, each of them contains the chance for that particular type.
